# nf-core/differentialabundance: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [ImportRNASeq](#importrnaseq) - If using RNASeq files, this re-writes the input to the standard differentialabundance format
- [DESeq2](#deseq2) - Differential expression analysis with DESeq2
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### ImportRNASeq

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `importrnaseqcounts/`
  - `modified_counts.tsv`: Modified counts table.
  - `modified_samplesheet.csv`: Modified sample sheet.

</details>

### DESeq2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `deseq2/`
  - `*.dds.rld.rds*`: R object saving the DESeq2 results for further analysis.

</details>

[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) is a package for differential expression analysis.

<!-- TODO -->

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
